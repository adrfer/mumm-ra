# Mumm-Ra
The script that transforms your decayed machine into an awesome development one.

Mumm-Ra wouldn't exist if it wasn't for awesome prior art. It's been inspired by thoughtbot's great [laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) project.

Tested on `GNU bash 3.2.57` and `Git 2.8.4`.

**Note:** Mumm-Ra can be run as many times as needed on the same machine safely. Installs, upgrades, and/or skips are based on what is already installed on the machine. So, no worries!


## Usage

Open a terminal and run:

    bash <(curl -sL https://raw.github.com/adrfer/mumm-ra/master/transform) && . ~/.bash_profile

Feel free to review and modify the script to your needs!
